# Concepts

## Question 1
What is the difference between a game with **imperfect information** and **incomplete information**? 

## Question 2

Describe the conditions for a **Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE)** and **Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE)**. Explain the two types of potential equilibria in any Bayesian game.

## Question 3

Explain the framework of a **signaling** game. What kind of equilibrium is a good signal seeking to attain? (Think back to question 2.) What makes for a good signal? Give some examples.

# Problems

## Question 4

A group of police officers have breathalyzers that never fail to detect a truly drunk person. However, the breathalyzer displays false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk.

Suppose the police officers stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. Assume we don't know anything else; *what is the probability the driver truly is drunk?*

**Hint**: you will first need to find the probability of a positive result overall, use the law of total probability: $P(B)=P(B|A)P(A)+P(B|\text{Not }A)P(\text{Not }A)$, Drawing a probability tree may also help visualize.

## Question 5

Consider the following game: A (partially-drunk) <span style=color:blue;>Local</span> is at a bar in the Old West, potentially looking to pick a fight. A <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> comes to the bar for breakfast. The <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> is either <span style=color:blue;>Tough</span> or <span style=color:blue;>Weak</span>, and the <span style=color:red;>Local</span> does not know which. Suppose either type is *equally* likely (i.e. $p=0.50)$. If the <span style=color:red;>Local</span> picks a <span style=color:red;>Fight</span>, the <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> earns a payoff of <span style=color:blue;>2</span>, and if the <span style=color:red;>Local</span> chooses to <span style=color:red;>Ignore</span>, the <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> earns <span style=color:blue;>4</span>. The <span style=color:red;>Local</span> earns <span style=color:red;>0</span> from <span style=color:red;>Ignoring</span>, <span style=color:red;>2</span> from <span style=color:red;>Fighting</span> a <span style=color:blue;>*weak* Stranger</span>, and <span style=color:red;>-1</span> against a <span style=color:blue;>*tough* Stranger</span>. The <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> first decides on breakfast: <span style=color:blue;>Quiche</span> (at a cost of 0), or <span style=color:blue;>Beer</span>, which costs 1 for a tough and 3 for a weak <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span>. The game is set up in the tree below.

For the questions below, when contemplating a potential a **Bayesian Perfect Nash Equilibrium (BPNE)**, each player must (1) have sequentially rational strategies that consistent with backwards induction and (2) have consistent beliefs about the other player. As hints, for (1), consider <span style=color:red;>Local</span>'s *expected* payoff to picking a strategy against the two types of <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> given <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span>'s breakfast selection. For (2), no need to worry about Bayes' Law here, just think about what beliefs <span style=color:red;>Local</span> must have about <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span>'s type, conditional on observing <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span>'s breakfast choice, in each of the 4 equilibria.

### Part A

Under what conditions (if any) can a **pooling BPNE equilibrium** exist where *both* types of <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> choose <span style=color:blue;>Beer</span>?

### Part B

Under what conditions (if any) can a **pooling BPNE equilibrium** exist where *both* types of <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> choose <span style=color:blue;>Quiche</span>?

### Part C

Under what conditions (if any) can a **separating BPNE equilibrium** exist where a *weak* <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> chooses <span style=color:blue;>Beer</span> and a *tough* <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> chooses <span style=color:blue;>Quiche</span>?

### Part D

Under what conditions (if any) can the **separating BPNE equilibrium** exist where a *weak* <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> chooses <span style=color:blue;>Quiche</span> and a *tough* <span style=color:blue;>Stranger</span> chooses <span style=color:blue;>Beer</span>? 

### Part E

Describe why the signal sent in this game can successfully achieve a separating equilibrium.
