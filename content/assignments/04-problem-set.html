<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>Consider the simple hand game of “odds and evens,” where two players simultaneously hold out one or two of their fingers, and add up the sum. Suppose Player 1 has chosen Odds, and Player 2 has chosen Evens, such that the sum is odd, Player 1 wins; if the sum is even, Player 2 wins. Let a win be a payoff of 1, and a loss be a payoff of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. The payoff table is below:</p>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>You and your friend are deciding on a place to go for dinner, but are too busy to call or text one another. Each of you can go to the Chinese Restaurant or the Italian Restaurant – suppose you prefer Chinese and your friend prefers Italian.</p>

<p>Write out and draw each player’s best response function. Put <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> on the horizontal axis and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> on the vertical axis.

<h2>Part I</h2>
<p>Given your answers to the above questions, calculate the probability that both of you go to the Chinese restaurant and the probability that both of you go to the Italian restaurant. Hint: assume each person’s choice is independent.</p>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>The chief of police is attempting to crack down on drunk driving, and is deciding whether to set up a sobriety checkpoint. Setting up a checkpoint always catches drunk driving, but costs the city resources. A partygoer can choose to drink Beer or Soda before driving home. Suppose the payoffs are as follows:</p>
