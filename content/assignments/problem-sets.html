<p>There will be several problem sets (typically 5-6) spaced throughout the semester. Typically, after we cover a major concept or set of tools, I will assign a problem set to practice this material.</p>
<p>Problem sets are typically due one week from the class period it is assigned (although the due date announced on the problem set is the final authority on this), and must handed in or emailed to me by the start of class (so please type or, if you must, hand write and scan them).</p>
<p>You can either print the PDF and write your answers on the sheet, or write (or type) your answers on your own paper and turn that in (i.e. I don’t need the questions and the answers, just your answers on paper).</p>
<p>You may work together (and I highly encourage that) but you must turn in your own answers.</p>
<p>I grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, pick one question to grade for accuracy — so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately.</p>
