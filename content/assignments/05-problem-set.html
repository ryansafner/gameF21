<h1>Concepts</h1>
<div id="question-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>What is the difference between a <strong>finitely</strong> repeated game and an <strong>infinitely</strong> repeated game? What is the pure strategy Nash equilibrium in a finitely-repeated game (with a unique Nash equilibrium in a one-shot version)? Describe <em>two</em> interpretations of <em>infinitely</em> repeated games.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>Describe, in your own words, the simple version (or implications) of the <strong>folk theorem</strong> for sustaining cooperation.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>Describe what a <strong>subgame</strong> means, and circle all subgames in the following game tree.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/hw_hansel_gretel.png" width="350"></p>
</div>
<div id="question-4" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>Define <strong>subgame perfect Nash equilibrium</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-5" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>Explain what <strong>strategic moves</strong> are, and explain the three major types of strategic moves.</p>
</div>
<div id="question-6" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 6</h2>
<p>What makes a <em>promise</em> <strong>credible</strong>? What makes a <em>threat</em> <strong>credible</strong>? Give some examples of each, and in your answers, use the concept of <strong>subgame perfection.</strong></p>
</div>
<div id="question-7" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 7</h2>
<p>What makes a strategy <strong>evolutionarily stable</strong> (ESS)? Describe the difference between <strong>monomorphic</strong> and <strong>polymorphic</strong> equilibria.</p>

<h1>Problems</h1>
<div id="question-8" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 8</h2>
<p>Consider an evolutionary version of the Stag Hunt game, where members of a species can decide to cooperate and hunt a <strong>Stag</strong> together, or defect and go after a <strong>Hare</strong> on their own.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/stag_hunt_abstract.png" width="350"></p>
<div id="part-a" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>Is <strong>Stag</strong> an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Is <strong>Hare</strong> an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>What are the pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) of this game? Reconcile this with your answers in parts a and b.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-d" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>Suppose the environment changes such that hunting a large <strong>Hare</strong> <em>alone</em> is equally rewarding to the cooperative hunt of a <strong>Stag</strong> (but if they both hunt <strong>Hare</strong>, it is less rewarding).</p>
<p><img src="../../images/stag_hunt_equal_hare.png" width="350"></p>
<p>Under the new environment, is <strong>Hare</strong> evolutionarily stable (ESS)?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-e" class="section level3">
<h3>Part E</h3>
<p>Under the new environment, is <strong>Stag</strong> evolutionarily stable (ESS)?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-f" class="section level3">
<h3>Part F</h3>
<p>Given what we learned in class about the relationship between (pure strategy) Nash equilibria and evolutionarily stable strategies, we now need a new refinement. Define a <strong><em>strict</em> Nash equilibrium</strong> in pure strategies to mean that each player is playing a <strong>strict</strong> (or <strong>unique</strong>) best response to other players, i.e. there is no <em>other</em> strategy that is <em>also</em> a best response to another player. In the one-shot game in part d, which PSNE are <strong>strict</strong>, and which are not (i.e. “weak” PSNE? What do you then think is the relationship between ESS and strict/non-strict PSNE?</p>

<h2>Question 9</h2>
<p>Consider the evolutionary Hawk-Dove game, where members of a species are competing over a resource valued at 12, with a cost of losing a fight being <span class="math inline">\(-15\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Part F</h3>

<div id="question-10" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 10</h2>
<p>Consider the following game between two roommates. Roommate A has a very difficult exam the next morning, while Roommate B does not. The two of them can each decide to Study or Go Out that evening. Both would rather do something together, while A would certainly prefer they both Study and B would prefer they both Go Out.</p>
<div id="part-a-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>Suppose they both agree that A gets to decide first and B must respond, as in the following game:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/hw_5_roommates.png" width="350"></p>
<p>Solve this game for the rollback equilibrium using backwards induction.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Circle all subgames on the game tree.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Carefully convert this game from extensive form to strategic form. (Be mindful of how many potential strategies each player has!) Then, find any Nash equilibria in strategic form.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-d-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>Which Nash equilibrium is subgame perfect? Why?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-e-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part E</h3>
<p>Suppose in an attempt to get A to Go Out, B says they will Go Out regardless of what A does. If A still gets to decide first (i.e. it is the same game as in part a), what should A make of this?</p>
