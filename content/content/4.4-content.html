<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>Today we begin to relax our assumption of perfect information in games, and look at games with imperfect, and incomplete information. The typical type of incomplete information game is a game of asymmetric information — where (at least) one player has private information (about their type), that the other player(s) does not know. These are considered Bayesian games, since the players must act on their <em>beliefs</em> about the other players, and update their beliefs based on their actions accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><i class="fas fa-book"></i> Ch. 6.3, 8 in Dixit, Skeath, and Riley (textbook)</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 6.3 talks about information sets and sequential games. Chapter 8 is about incomplete information, though unfortunately the textbook does not go into great detail about Bayesian games.</p>
<p>Below is the famous paper by Harsanyi that introduces Bayesian games and the common strategy for dealing with incomplete information.</p>

<h2><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides</h2>
<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
