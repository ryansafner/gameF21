## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we begin looking at simultaneous games.

## <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

While the textbook does briefly describe the economics of oligopoly in passing, they do not get into the details, nor do they look at the canonical models that we will study. As such, for today I can only recommend my slides to assist you. 

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.

The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
