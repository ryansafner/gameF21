## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

Today we begin looking at the role of credibility and commitment in affecting games. In order to do so, we must first return to sequential games, and learn a new solution concept, **subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE)**.

## <i class="fas fa-book-reader fa-lg"></i> Readings

- <i class="fas fa-book"></i> Chs. 10 in Dixit, Skeath, and Riley (textbook)

## <i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides

Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.

The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (*not everything* is in the slides)!
