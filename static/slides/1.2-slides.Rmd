# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have .hi[objectives] they value

- Agents face .hi[constraints]

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

- Traditional economic models are often called .hi[“Decision theory”]:

- .hi-purple[Optimization models] **ignore all other agents** and just focus on how can **you** maximize **your** objective within **your** constraints
  - Consumers max utility; firms max profit, etc.

- **Outcome**: .hi-purple[optimum]: decision where *you* have no better alternatives

# Game Theory vs. Decision Theory Models I

- Traditional economic models are often called .hi[“Decision theory”]:

- .hi-purple[Equilibrium models] assume that there are **so many agents** that **no agent’s decision can affect the outcome**
  - Firms are price-takers or the *only* buyer or seller
  - **Ignores all other agents’ decisions**!

# So What About the Numbers?

- Utility thought to be lurking in people's brains

# Utility Functions?

.pull-left[

- More plausibly .hi-turquoise[infer people's preferences from their actions]!
  - “Actions speak louder than words”

- .hi-purple[Principle of Revealed Preference]: if a person chooses $x$ over $y$, and both are affordable, then they must prefer $x \succeq y$
	
- Flawless? Of course not. But extremely useful approximation!
  - People tend not to leave money on the table

# Utility Functions!

.pull-left[

- A .hi[utility function] $u(\cdot)$<sup>.hi[†]</sup> *represents* preference relations $(\succ , \prec , \sim)$

- Assign utility numbers to bundles, such that, for any bundles $a$ and $b$:
$$a \succ b \iff u(a)>u(b)$$

# Utility Functions, Pural III

.pull-left[
- Utility numbers have an .hi-purple[ordinal] meaning only, **not cardinal**

- Both are valid utility functions:
    - $u(c)>u(b)>u(a)$ ✅
    - $v(c)>v(b)>v(a)$ ✅
    - because $c \succ b \succ a$

# Utility Functions and Payoffs Over Game Outcomes

- Players understand the rules of the game
  - Common knowledge assumption

- Players behave .hi[rationally]: try to maximize payoff

  - make no mistakes in choosing their strategies

# Rationality, Uncertainty, and Risk

.pull-left[

- Game theory does not permit us to consider true .hi-purple[uncertainty]
  - Must rule out *complete* surprises (Act of God, etc.)
  - What do people maximize in the presence of true uncertainty? [Good question](https://micros21.classes.ryansafner.com/content/3.3-content)

- But we can talk about .hi[risk]: distribution of outcomes occurring with some known **probability**

# Rationality, Uncertainty, and Risk

.pull-left[

- One hypothesis: players choose strategy that maximizes .hi-purple[expected value] of payoffs
  - probability-weighted average
  - leads to a lot of paradoxes!

$$E[p] = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i p_i$$

- $\pi$ is the probability associated with payoff $p_i$

# Rationality, Uncertainty, and Risk

.pull-left[
- Refinement by Von Neuman & Morgenstern: players instead maximize .hi[expected *utility*]
  - utility function over probabilistic outcomes
  - still some paradoxes, but fewer!

$$p_a \succ p_b \iff E[u(p_a)] > E[u(p_b)]$$

- Allows for different .hi-turquoise[risk attitudes]:
    - risk neutral, risk-averse, risk-loving

- makes utility functions **cardinal** (but still not measurable!)
  - called VNM utility functions

# Pareto Efficiency and Games

.pull-left[

- Take the **prisoners’ dilemma**

- .hi-purple[Nash Equilibrium]: (.hi-red[Defect], .hi-blue[Defect])
  - neither player has an incentive to change strategy, *given the other's strategy*

- Why can’t they both **cooperate**?
  - A clear .hi-purple[Pareto improvement]!

# Pareto Efficiency and Games

.pull-left[

- Main feature of prisoners’ dilemma: the Nash equilibrium is Pareto inferior to another outcome (.hi-red[Cooperate], .hi-blue[Cooperate])!
  - But that outcome is *not* a Nash equilibrium!
  - Dominant strategies to **Defect**

- How can we ever get rational cooperation?

# Nash Equilibrium and Solution Concepts

.pull-left[

- This is **far** from the last word on solution concepts, or even Nash equilibrium!

- But sufficient for now, until we return to simultaneous games

- Next week, **sequential games**!
