- This semester, we are dealing with .hi[non-cooperative games] where each player acts independently

- In .hi-purple[coordination games], players don't necessarily have conflicting interests
  - Often .hi-turquoise[positive-sum games]
  - Often have more than one, or zero, Pure Strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE)

&gt; “[I]t is instructive to begin with the...case in which two or more parties have identical interests and face the problem not of reconciling interests but only of coordinating their actions for their mutual benefit, when communication is impossible.”

&gt; “When a man loses his wife in a department store without any prior understanding on where to meet if they get separated, the chances are good that they will find each other. It is likely that each will think of some obvious place to meet, so obvious that each will be sure that the other is sure that it is ‘obvious’ to both of them. One does not simply predict where the other will go, since the other will go where he predicts the first to go, which is wherever the first predicts the second to predict the first to go, and so ad infinitum.”

&gt; “What is necessary is to coordinate predictions, to read the same message in the common situation, to identify the one course of action that their expectations of each other can converge on. They must ‘mutually recognize’ some unique signal that coordinates their expectations of each other. We cannot be sure that they will meet, nor would all couples read the same signal; but the chances are certainly a great deal better than if they pursued a random course of search.” (p.54).

- Can *all* players potentially benefit from the interaction?
  - No: chicken

- Do all players prefer one outcome over another?
  - Yes: assurance game

- Does the players prefer *different* outcomes?
  - Yes: battle of the sexes

- Is there a Pareto improvement from Nash equilibrium?
  - Yes: assurance game
  - Yes, but it's not a NE: prisoners' dilemma

# Multiple Equilibria: What to Do?

# Rationalizability and Best Reponses

.pull-left[

- What is key here is that players can rationalize playing a strategy if it is .hi-turquoise[a best response to at least one strategy]

- Inversely, .hi-turquoise[if a strategy is *never* a best response, playing it is not rationalizable]

- For this game, since each strategy is *sometimes* a best-response, for both players, all 9 outcomes are rationalizable
