- Axelrod's discussion of successful strategies based on four properties:
  1. **Niceness**: cooperate, never be the first to defect
  2. **Be Provocable**: don't be suckered by being too nice, return defection with defection
  3. **Don't be envious**: focus on maximizing your own score, rather than ensuring your score is higher than your "partner's"
  4. **Don't be too clever**: clarity is essential for others to cooperate with you

- The winning strategy was, famously, **TIT FOR TAT**, submitted by Anatol Rapoport

    - Each player can observe history

        - sufficiently high probability of game continuing `\(\theta\)`
- If this is true, *many* strategies can sustain long-run cooperation
    - Any in the teal set in the diagram before
    - *Grim trigger* is simply the bare minimum/worst case scenario (and, importantly, easiest to model!)

  - This is why game theorists use the grim trigger strategy results as the *bare minimum* sufficient strategy for cooperation

# Using Market Forces to Enforce Contracts: Reputation

&gt; "Since every contingency cannot be cheaply specified in a contract or even known and because legal redress is expensive, transactors will generally also rely on an implicit type of long-term contract that employs a market rather than legal enforcement mechanism, namely, the imposition of a capital loss by the withdrawal of expected future business. This goodwill market-enforcement mechanism undoubtedly is a major element of the contractual alternative to vertical integration," (p.303)

&gt; "One way in which this market mechanism of contract enforcement may operate is by offering to the potential cheater a future 'premium,' more precisely, a price sufficiently greater than average variable (that is, avoidable) cost to assure a quasi-rent stream that will exceed the potential gain from cheating. The present-discounted value of this future premium stream must be greater than any increase in wealth that could be obtained by the potential cheater if he, in fact, cheated and were terminated. The offer of such a long-term relationship with the potential cheater will eliminate systematic opportunistic behavior," (p.304).

&gt; "The larger the potential one-time 'theft' by cheating (the longer and more costly to detect a violation, enforce the contract, switch suppliers, and so forth) and the shorter the expected continuing business relationship, the higher this premium will be in a nondeceiving equilibrium. This may therefore partially explain both the reliance by firms on long-term implicit contracts with particular suppliers and the existence of reciprocity agreements among firms...The threat of termination of this relationship mutually suppresses opportunistic behavior. The premium stream can be usefully thought of as insurance payments made by the firm to prevent cheating," (pp.304-5)

&gt; “Any profits are competed away in equilibrium by competitive expenditures on fixed (sunk) assets, such as initial specific investments (for example, a sign) with low or zero salvage value if the firm cheats, necessary to enter and obtain this preferred position of collecting the premium stream. These fixed (sunk) costs of supplying credibility of future performance are repaid or covered by future sales on which a premium is earned. .hi[In equilibrium,the premium stream is then merely a normal rate of return on the 'reputation,' or 'brand-name' capital created by the firm by these initial expenditures.] This brand-name capital, .hi[the value of which is highly specific to contract fulfillment by the firm], is analytically .hi[equivalent to a forfeitable collateral bond put up by the firm which is anticipated to face an opportunity to take advantage of appropriable quasi rents in specialized assets],” (p.306).

Milgrom, North, and Weingast (1990) model these interactions as a multi-stage repeated game (p.11):

1. Traders may (at a cost `\(Q&gt;0\)`) ask LM (publicly reports whether any trader has any unpaid judgments) about their current partner
2. Two traders play a prisoners' dilemma (**Honest** or **Cheat**)
3. If LM was asked before (in stage 1), either player may **Appeal** outcome to LM at a cost `\(C&gt;0\)`
4. If **Appealed**, LM awards damages `\((J)\)` to Plaintiff if he was Honest and his partner Cheated; otherwise nothing 
5. Defendant chooses to **Pay** `\(J\)` or **Not**
6. Unpaid judgments recorded by LM
