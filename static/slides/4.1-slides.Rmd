# A Motivating Example

.pull-left[
- Suppose I announce that if any of you were late, I would give you an F

- If you believe my threat, you will arrive on time, and I never have to carry out my threat

- *Sounds* like a Nash equilibrium:
  - I get what I want at no cost to me
  - You prefer being in class on time to failing
  - Nobody wants to change

]

# A Motivating Example

.pull-left[
- Implausible prediction: I would not actually want to carry out my threat if it came to it!
    - Big confrontation, you could complain to Dept. chair, Provost, etc

- A problem of “out-of-equilibrium” play
    - How can a threat *I will never carry out* change your behavior?
    - I can optimally choose bizarre behavior in situations I know will never happen!

# A Motivating Example

.pull-left[
- BUT: if you know what *would* happen in those unlikely scenarios, that *does* affect your behavior for things that *normally* happen
    - namely, if you know I will not *actually* fail you for coming late, you will sometimes come late

# Motivating Example

.pull-left[
- This lesson is about the effects of .hi[threats] and .hi[promises]

- Must learn another major refinement of Nash equilibrium

- First, return to seqential games

- Continue with assumption of perfect information (soon we will consider imperfect information)

# Motivating Example

.pull-left[

- A new solution concept:

- .hi[Subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE)]: selects only Nash equilibria sustained by .hi-purple[credible] threats and promises, and rules out *non-credible* threats/promises
    - Formal definition: a set of strategies is **SP** if it induces a Nash equilibrium in *every subgame* of a game
    
- First, let’s understand what we mean by “subgame”

# Subgames

.pull-left[
- A .hi[subgame] is any portion of a game that contains one initial note and all of its successor nodes
  - e.g. .hi-turquoise[any decision node initiates its own subgame] through to the terminal nodes
  - The game itself counts as a subgame
    
- Idea: analyze a subgame as a game itself and .hi-turquoise[ignore any history] in the overall game and .hi-turquoise[find what is optimal in each subgame]

# Subgames: Example

.pull-left[

  1. The full game itself (initiated by .red[Player 1]'s decision node .red[1.1])
  2. Subgame initiated by .blue[Player 2's] decision node .blue[2.1]
  3. Subgame initiated by .blue[Player 2's] decision node .blue[2.2]

# Aside: Subgames Can't Break Information Sets

.pull-left[

- Subgames cannot “break” .hi-purple[information sets]
  - Indicated by dashed line: .blue[Player 2] does not know what .red[Player 1] chose (consider it a simultaneous game)
  - More on information later

- Players must *know which* subgame they are in, so a subgame cannot “break” an information set
  - .blue[Player 2] here would not know what .red[Player 1] did, so .red[Player 1] can’t make a decision; could not “ignore history”
