# Game Theory

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- Game theory appears somewhat tautological
  - Result of game is baked into the rules of a game specified
  - Game theorists often know the result even before the players play

- More useful as a **theoretical framework** for understanding strategic interactions
  - If players were rational and had perfect information — what would they do?
  - Compare the (theory) prediction with reality
      - Do players act differently in reality?

# When Results are Not as Predicted

.pull-left[

- Behavioral economists:
  - Did players make a mistake? Act less than "rational"?
  - Cognitive biases, behavioral economics explanations
  - Did players not understand the rules?

- Game theorists:
  - Did you specify the game correctly?
  - Are the rules correctly modeled?
  - Are the payoffs correctly specified?

# Research with Game Theory

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Most fruitful part of research (in my biased opinion) is using game theory to understand the role of *institutions* (norms, culture, shared histories, government policies, etc.)
    - Coordination devices
    - Focal points
    - Sorting between multiple Nash equilibria
    - Path dependent outcomes
    - Making threats/promises credible
    - Making exchanges self-enforcing
    - Resolving asymmetric information problems 

- We'll see this starting this week, and in the papers we'll read

# The Two Major Models of Economics as a “Science”

.pull-left[

## Optimization

- Agents have .hi[objectives] they value

- Agents face .hi[constraints]

- Make .hi[tradeoffs] to maximize objectives within constraints

.center[
![](../images/optimize.jpeg)

.pull-right[

## Equilibrium

- Agents .hi[compete] with others over **scarce** resources

- Agents .hi[adjust] behaviors based on prices

- .hi[Stable outcomes] when adjustments stop

# Game Theory vs. Decision Theory Models I

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

- Traditional economic models are often called .hi[“Decision theory”]:

- .hi-purple[Optimization models] **ignore all other agents** and just focus on how can **you** maximize **your** objective within **your** constraints
  - Consumers max utility; firms max profit, etc.

- **Outcome**: .hi-purple[optimum]: decision where *you* have no better alternatives

.pull-right[

- Traditional economic models are often called .hi[“Decision theory”]:

- .hi-purple[Equilibrium models] assume that there are **so many agents** that **no agent’s decision can affect the outcome**
  - Firms are price-takers or the *only* buyer or seller
  - **Ignores all other agents’ decisions**!

- **Outcome**: .hi-purple[equilibrium]: where *nobody* has any better alternative

# Game Theory vs. Decision Theory Models III

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

- .hi[Game theory models] directly confront .hi-purple[strategic interactions] between players
  - How each player would optimally respond to a strategy chosen by other player(s)
  - Lead to a stable outcome where everyone has considered and chosen mutual best responses

- **Outcome**: .hi-purple[Nash equilibrium]: where *nobody* has a better strategy **given the strategies everyone else is playing**

# Equilibrium in Games

.pull-left[
.center[
![:scale 90%](../images/chessknights.jpg)

]

.pull-right[

- .hi-purple[Nash Equilibrium]: 
  - no player wants to change their strategy **given all other players’ strategies**
  - each player is playing a **best response** against other players’ strategies

]

---

# A Suggested Framework

.pull-left[

I. Identify the strategic interaction
  - Who are the players
  - What choices can they make?
  - How does the *interaction* of their choices determine outcomes for each player?

# A Suggested Framework

.pull-left[

.smallest[
II. Model the game: rules, payoffs, etc (*often the hard part!*)
  - Ordering of choices -- sequential, simultaneous?
      - Information -- what does each player know and not know
      - One-shot or repeated?
      - If repeated: a finite number of times? an infinite number of times? ending with certain probability?
  - Define the payoffs (*again, the hard part*!)
      - use *economic theory* to determine how various interactions should affect various outcomes for each player
      - numerical payoffs make things easy, but constrain you to fewer possibilities
      - using *variables* in payoffs allows you to solve for the *conditions* that will yield *different Nash equilibria*

# A Suggested Framework

.pull-left[

III. Predict the outcome(s)
  - Solve for Nash equilibria
    - If applicable, consider: pure vs. mixed strategies, one-shot vs. repeated games
  - If using variables in payoffs, what values of variables will give us various equilibria?
  - If multiple equilibria -- any reasons we should expect one over others?

# A Suggested Framework

.pull-left[
.smallest[
IV. Compare reality with predictions
  - Are there behavioral reasons players do not reach predicted outcome? 
  - Are there institutions, policies, norms, ethics, etc. that lead players towards/away from certain outcomes?
    
V. Consider changes in the game
  - What would have to change (payoffs, rules, etc) to get different outcomes?
  - Are there policies or institutions that might affect or cause this?
  - Consider welfare of players: how do the players do? How could this be improved?

# Basic Game

.pull-left[
- Solve this game by backwards induction:

- Consumer will Purchase when:
  - `\(R&gt;P\)`: costlier to copy than to purchase
  - `\(V&gt;P\)`: price to buy is lower than value (i.e. consumer surplus, `\(V-P \geq 0\)`)

- Producer will Produce when:
  - Consumer Purchases
  - `\(P&gt;F-C\)`: revenue exceeds cost

# Mechanisms to Enhance Cooperation

.pull-left[

- An agent ("patron") bears the fixed costs (F) in exchange for some of the following:
    - Distribution rights (copyrights); personal prestige; portion of profits; rewards
- Deterrence of pirating &amp; shirking (raise R relative to P)
    - Technology affects replication costs; Customization, product differentiation, price discrimination; Legal threats; Reputation
- Compare three systems:
    1. Patronage of the arts
    2. Copyright
    3. Crowdfunding

  - `\(D\)`: damages from copyright lawsuit
  - `\(\sigma\)`: probability of getting caught/sued
  - .red[Creator] gains `\(\sigma D\)` (from lawsuit against .blue[Consumer]), but must pay `\(E\)` for enforcement costs (legal fees)

# Example II: 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century American Literary Piracy

.pull-left[

.smallest[
- U.S. publishers' piracy of foreign authors in the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century faced a tragedy of the commons:
  - No exclusive claims over printing foreign works (no copyright `\(\implies\)` no right to exclude)

- Solved this problem by creating a publishing cartel that created "property rights" in piracy of foreign authors

- Enabled protectionist resistance to calls for respecting international copyrights 
  - System broke down by end of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century
  - Rising U.S. cultural output in 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century: publishers now advocate for international copyrights

# Game Setup

- Publisher 2 moves second and can decide to publish:
    - the *same* author as 1 ("pirate") at lower cost `\(\hat{p}&lt;p; \hat{c}&lt;c\)` or 
    - the *other* author at cost `\(c\)`

# Game Setup

    - If publisher 2 pirates, can sell at lower price than publisher 1
    - If both publish different authors, each earns `\(p_i-c\)`, where `\(i=\{A, B\}\)`

# Game Setup

.pull-left[
- Piracy/original publishing depends on: 
  - relative value of author `\(A\)` vs `\(B\)`
  - profits of original sales `\((p_i-c)\)` vs. profits of pirate sales `\((\hat{p_i}-\hat{c})\)`
    - both demand for pirated works `\((\hat{p_i})\)` and reproduction technology `\((\hat{c})\)`

# Game Outcome - Role of Institutions

.pull-left[
- Parameters `\(p_A\)`, `\(p_B\)`, `\(c\)`, and `\(\hat{c}\)` are determined by market conditions and institutions:

- Historically, several methods to secure property rights and deter piracy from other publishers
  - Arts patronage
  - Monopoly/guild (Stationers' Company of London)
  - Internal trade organizations
  - Copyright law

# The Cartel Solution: “Courtesy of the Trade”

- 1790—1891 U.S. did not recognize copyrights to foreign authors

- U.S. publishing industry largely pirated famous British authors
 - Set up “courtesy of the trade” system of voluntary norms to avoid tragedy of commons
 - Created pseudo-property rights in foreign authors works
 - Ended up paying authors despite no obligation to, nor any legal protection earned

# The Cartel Solution: “Courtesy of the Trade”

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- 1790—1891 U.S. did not recognize copyrights to foreign authors

- Resolved the tragedy of the commons problem via a cartel
- A publisher would announce which foreign author they would publish and stake their "claim"
  - Other publishers would refrain from republishing that author, in hopes that when they stake a claim on a different author, others would respect it
  - If didn't respect claims, retaliation: nobody would respect their future claims

# More General Solutions

.pull-left[

- 1891 International Copyright Act “respects” foreign copyrights in U.S.
  - “Manufacturing clause” required foreign works to be printed in U.S.
  - Rationale for “trade courtesy” cartel disappears

- U.S. publishers begin publishing U.S. authors
  - Now in their interest to push for other countries to respect U.S. copyright
