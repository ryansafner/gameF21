# Another Motivating Example: Why Professors Are Mean

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Most professors have a lateness policy where late homework is either not accepted, or points are lost

- Not (necessarily) because professors are mean!

- Suppose a student hands in homework late and has a plausible excuse

- Most professors actually are generous and accommodating, will make an exception

- But if students know this, all students will try plausible excuses and everything becomes late

- Professor can **commit** to a bright-line policy from the beginning (i.e. in syllabus)

- Removes professor's discretion in individual cases

- Salespeople have same limitations from "manager" or "man upstairs" preventing better deals

&gt; “.hi[How can one commit himself in advance to an act that he would in fact prefer not to carry out in the event,] in order that his commitment may deter the other party? ... In bargaining, the commitment is a device to leave the last clear chance to decide the outcome with the other party, in a manner that he fully appreciates; it is to relinquish further initative, having rigged the incentives so that the other party must choose in one's favor. If one driver speeds up so that he cannot stop, and the other realizes it, the latter has to yield...This doctrine helps to understand some of those cases in which .hi[bargaining 'strength' inheres in what is weakness by other standards.],” (p.22).

# Ways to Commit and Make Strategies Credible

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- *Dixit and Nalebuff* (Ch. 7) describe 8 methods to make strategies credible (and also suggestions for countering them): 

1. Write enforceable contracts
2. Establish and stake your reputation on your actions
3. Cut off communication
4. Burn bridges behind you
5. Leave the outcome beyond your control, or to chance
6. Move in small steps
7. Develop credibility through teamwork
8. Employ mandated agents

&gt; “Given the importance of credit sales, the diamond industry depends overwhelmingly on the reliable enforcement of executory contracts. However, while most industries employ state-sponsored courts to enforce payment after the delivery of goods, public courts are toothless to enforce credit sales for diamonds. Diamons are easily portable and command extreme value throughout the world. A diamond thief encounters little difficulty in hiding unpaid-for or stolen diamonds from law enforcement officials, fleeing American jurisdiction, and selling the valuable diamonds to black market buyers,” (p.392).

&gt; “Brinkmanship is thus the deliberate creation of a recognizable risk of war, a risk that one does not completely control. It is the tactic of deliberately letting the situation get somewhat out of hand, just because its being out of hand may be intolerable to the other party and force his accomodation. It means harassing and intimidating an adversary by exposing him to a shared risk, or deterring him by showing that if he makes a contrary move he may disturb us so that we slip over the brink whether we want to or not, carrying him with us,” (p.200).

- Consider again the  .hi-purple[agency/investment/trust] game

- .red[Principal] decides to .red[invest] money ($100) with .blue[Agent]
  - Investment grows to $200

- .blue[Agent] can then .blue[keep] or .blue[share] the returns with .red[Principal]

- One solution: .hi-purple[reputation], which acts like a forfeitable .hi-purple[bond]

- If .blue[Agent] chooses to .blue[Keep], will lose -H, which is “hostage” value

  - `\(\alpha = 0\)`: hostage has no value to .red[Principal]
  - `\(\alpha = 1\)`: cash

# Making Promises Credible

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Common type of bond is reputation, which people can invest in and is “held hostage” for good behavior
  - reneging on commitments destroys reputation
  - works best with repeat interactions, high discount rates (folk theorem!)
  
- Another is some collateral property that is forfeit if the contract is breached
  - Mortgages, secured loans, etc
