    - Each player doesn’t know what the other chose

  - Let .red[Row] move first (order really doesn't matter with symmetric payoffs)

- .red[Row]’s move is hidden from .blue[Column]:
  - Can't distinguish between the **history** where .red[Row] chose .red[Stag] and the history where .red[Row] chose .red[Hare].

- Note changing who moves first here makes no difference on the game, since “second-mover” still does not know what “first-mover” chooses!

# Strategies and Information Sets

.pull-left[
- Strategies available to player within an information set must be the same across all decision nodes/histories

- If they are different, player can tell which history they are on given the unique strategies available to them
  - .blue[Column] would clearly know if they are at node .blue[C.1] or .blue[C.2] since strategies available are different!

  - Can’t play (.blue[Stag], .blue[Hare]) or (.blue[Hare], .blue[Stag]) at .blue[(C.1,C.2)]

# Strategies and Information Sets

.pull-left[
- Clarify what we mean by .hi[strategy]: a complete plan of action of all the decisions a player will make at every possible **information set**
  - (rather than merely every decision node)

- Until now, information sets have consisted of a single decision node (“singleton”)
]

# Perfect Information

.pull-left[
- We can now more precisely define .hi[perfect information]: no information sets contain multiple decision nodes (are all “singleton” nodes)

- Individual can differentiate between histories of game at each decision node

  1. .blue[(Stag, Stag)]
  2. .blue[(Stag, Hare)]
  3. .blue[(Hare, Stag)]
  4. .blue[(Hare, Hare)]

- Each information set is a singleton (i.e. nodes .blue[C.1] and .blue[C.2] each contain a separate information set)

2. {.red[Stag], .blue[(Stag, Hare)]}
3. {.red[Hare], .blue[(Hare, Hare)]}

# Imperfect Information and Subgame Perfection

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- With .hi-purple[imperfect information], some information sets contain multiple decision nodes

- A subgame must contain all nodes in the information set, cannot “break” information sets
  - Nodes .blue[2.1] and .blue[2.2] do *not* initiate subgames (breaks information sets)
  - The *only* subgame possible is the overall game itself (contains all nodes in information set)
  
- We **cannot** use subgame perfection as a solution concept here

# Imperfect Info. May Imply A Simultaneous Game

.pull-left[

- .blue[Column] cannot play any *conditional* strategies depending on what .red[Row] does
  - Can’t know what .red[Row] will play!
  - Must choose an *unconditional* strategy to always play .blue[Stag] or .blue[Hare]
  
- All we can do is solve the game via strategic form as usual

# Incomplete Information

# Incomplete Information

.pull-left[
- Even in games with imperfect information (e.g. simultaneous games), we have assumed information was .hi-purple[complete]
  - Players know the rules, strategies available, and the payoffs to each player

- Source of uncertainty was .hi-purple[strategic]: players didn’t know the **history** of the game (moves made by other players)
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/uncertainty.jpg)

]

---

# Incomplete Information

.pull-left[
- Now consider games with .hi[incomplete information]
  - Players don’t know something about the game
  - Common example: what the payoffs to the other player are (but know your own)

- Textbook calls this .hi-purple[external uncertainty]: the game is not fully clear due to some undetermined external factors 
]

# External Uncertainty: Playing with Nature

.pull-left[
- We can deal with .hi-purple[external uncertainty] by including **Nature** as a player

- **Nature** has no strategic interest in the outcomes (has no payoff and no objectives)

- Really just a metaphor for rolling (possibly weighted) dice
]

.pull-right[
.center[

]

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- Consider a .red[Farmer] who (ignoring competition) must determine what crops to plant: .red[Beans], which do better in dry seasons; or .red[Rice] which does better in wet seasons

- Let **Nature** decide what the weather this season will be
  - With some probability $p$, **Nature** will “choose” a **wet** season

- .red[Farmer] can’t know what **Nature** chose
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature.png)

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- .red[Farmer] must maximize **expected payoff**

- Consider a mixed strategy “against” **Nature**

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- .red[Farmer] must maximize **expected payoff**

- Consider a mixed strategy “against” **Nature**

$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Beans}]&=E[\color{red}{Rice}] \\
2p &= 2-2p\\
p^\star &= 0.50 \\
\end{align*}$$

- If $p>0.50$, .red[Farmer] should plant .red[Rice]
- If $p<0.50$, .red[Farmer] should plant .red[Beans]

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature_normal.png)
]
]

---
# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- Now suppose .red[Farmer] can estimate (based on experience, forecasts, etc) $p$ to be 0.40

- Now .red[Farmer] has a pure strategy “against” **Nature**

$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Beans}]&<E[\color{red}{Rice}] \\
(0.40)2+(0.60)0+ &< (0.40)0+(0.60)2\\
0.80 < 1.20 \\
\end{align*}$$

- Definitely plant .red[Rice]

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

# Asymmetric Information & Simultaneous Bayesian Games

# Asymmetric Information

.pull-left[
- A particular type of incomplete information is .hi[asymmetric information], where players might not know all relevant information about others
  - Other player’s strategies, payoffs, preferences, or “type”

- Typically, one player has important .hi-purple[private information] about themself that other players are not privy to

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Pooling equilibrium II]: both .blue[Colin-types] play .blue[Defect], i.e. .blue[(D,D)]

- .red[Rowena] maximizes her *expected* payoff against unknown .blue[Colin-type] playing .blue[Defect]

$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Cooperate}] &= \color{red}{0}p+\color{red}{0}(1-p)\\
E[\color{red}{Cooperate}] &= \color{red}{0}\\
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Defect}] &= \color{red}{1}p+\color{red}{1}(1-p)\\
E[\color{red}{Defect}] &= \color{red}{1}\\
\end{align*}$$

- .red[Rowena] will always play .red[Defect]

- ✅ This is a valid .hi-purple[Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]: {.red[Defect], .blue[(Defect, Defect)]}
  - Where .blue[Colin]’s strategies are denoted for (.blue[PH-type Colin], .blue[SH-type Colin])

# Bayesian Nash Equilibria

.pull-left[
- Our two possible .hi-purple[Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE)]:

1. {.red[Defect], .blue[(Defect, Defect)]}, a .hi-turquoise[pooling equilibrium]

2. {.red[Defect], .blue[(Cooperate, Defect)]}, a .hi-turquoise[separating equilibrium], if $p>\frac{2}{3}$
  - If $p<\frac{2}{3}$, no equilibrium

- Note that these depend on .red[Rowena]’s .hi-purple[beliefs] about $p$!
  - Next...why these are **Bayesian** games
