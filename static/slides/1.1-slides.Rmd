# What A Game Is...in Math

.pull-left[

- A game is defined as $\Gamma = (s_1,s_2, \cdots, s_n;u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_n)$:

1. Players $i \in \{1,2,\cdots, N\}: N \geq 2$
2. Strategies $s_i \in \{S_i\}$
  - $S_i$ is the set of all strategies available to player $i$
3. Payoffs $u_i \in \{s_i, s_{\neg i}\}$
  - $u_i: S_i \times S \cdots S_{\neg i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

# Example: 2-person Game

2. Strategies
  - $s_1 \in S_1$ and $s_2 \in S_2$
3. Payoffs
  - $u_1 \in \{s_1, s_2\}$
  - $u_2 \in \{s_1, s_2\}$

# We Are Ruling Out Situations

.pull-left[

- Where strategy does not matter (i.e. pure chance)

- Without strategic interaction between players (i.e. a “single-player” game)

# Why Is This a Game?

.pull-left[
1. More than 1 player
2. Strategies available to each player
3. Payoffs jointly determined by strategies chosen

- You just don’t happen to know *who* the other player is
  - But you still need to think about (how to respond to) their strategies with your own

# We Can Represent This 

- We can represent this (and any) game in two ways:
  - Both describe all three elements of the game

.pull-left[

- .hi[“Normal”] or .hi[“Strategic”] form (a matrix)

# Solution Concepts

.pull-left[

- In order to be a useful tool/model, need a .hi[solution concept] to predict outcome
  - Otherwise, what’s the point of the model?

- Game theory models are a special type of .hi[equilibrium model], so we want to find the .hi[equilibrium] of a game

# Solution Concepts

# Types of Games

---

# Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games

.pull-left[

- .hi[Simultaneous games]: players choose strategies simultaneously

- Must *anticipate* what other players are likely to play *without knowing*

- .hi-green[Examples]: prisoners' dilemma, coordination game, RTS games, most sports, sealed-bid auction, secret ballot
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/sealedbid.png)
]
]

---

# Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games

.pull-left[

- .hi[Sequential games]: players make moves one at a time

- Often can *see the previous moves* of all players

- Must *look to the future* of how others will respond in order to determine what is optimal *now*

- .hi-green[Examples]: chess, poker, board games, strategy games, bargaining, negotiations
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/chesssequence.jpg)
]
]

---

# One-Shot vs. Repeated Games

.pull-left[

- .hi[One-shot game]: game between players with no *history* together, occurs only once

- Players do not know much about each other, know they will never encounter one another again

- .hi-green[Examples]: tipping while on vacation, strangers on a subway, game show contestants
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/strangers.jpg)
]
]

---

# One-Shot vs. Repeated Games

.pull-left[

- .hi[Repeated game]: game between *the same* players is played *more than once*

- Players know the *history* of the game with each other

- .hi-purple[Finitely-repeated game]: has a known final round

- .hi-purple[Infinitely-repeated game]: has no (or an unknown) final round

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/infinitelyrepeated.JPG)
]
]

---

# One-Shot vs. Repeated Games

.pull-left[

- Reputation and history matters more in repeated games

- More role for “emotional” responses
  - Aggressiveness, vindictiveness, retribution, forgiveness

- Some strategies may be good for a *one-shot* interaction but harmful in a *repeated* game

- .hi-green[Examples]: bargaining too hard, rude to employees/customers, fraud
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/feedback.png)

]

# Information

.pull-left[

- .hi[Perfect information]: all players know all of the rules, possible strategies, payoffs, and move history of all players

- All players know that all players know that all players know that ...
  - .hi-purple[“Common knowledge”]
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/publicopinion.jpg)
]
]

---

# Information

.pull-left[

- .hi[Imperfect information]: all players *don’t* necessarily have all information

- .hi-purple[“Strategic uncertainty”]: players may know the game, but not which strategies other players have chosen
  - i.e. a simultaneous game

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/uncertainty.jpg)
]
]

---

# Information

.pull-left[

- .hi[Incomplete information]: all players *don’t* have full information about the game (.hi-purple[“external uncertainty”])

- .hi-purple[Asymmetric information]: some players have more information than others
  - Player 1 doesn’t know the other player 2’s “type,” but they do
  - Player 2 may want to conceal their information, or may try to .hi-purple[signal] their type to Player 1

- .hi-green[Examples]: insurance, used cars, education, ordeals
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/information.png)
]
]

# Stability of the Rules

.pull-left[

- Rules of the game may be fixed and immutable

- Or players may be able to .hi-turquoise[manipulate the rules in their favor]
  - .hi-purple[“Strategic moves”]: *pre-game* game of determining rules for future game

- Making .hi[credible] .hi-purple[threats] or .hi-purple[promises] with .hi-purple[commitment]

- .hi-green[Examples]: constitutions, agenda-setting, strategic voting, entry deterrence
]

# Sum of the Game

.pull-left[

- A .hi-purple[zero/constant sum game]: player(s) gain only at the expense of other player(s)

- .hi-green[Examples]: sports, board games, division of a surplus
]

.pull-left[
.center[
![](../images/penaltykick.jpg)
]
]

---

# Sum of the Game

.pull-left[

- A .hi-purple[positive sum game]: all players can potential benefit from interaction
  - .hi-green[Example]: trade, bargaining

- A .hi-purple[negative sum game]: all players can potentially be harmed from interaction
  - .hi-green[Example]: war, conflict, rent-seeking

# Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will: 

1. Recognize different types of strategic interactions across different domains (e.g. economics, business, political science, biology, etc.)
2. Recognize common types of games, e.g. prisoners' dilemma, stag hunt, battle of the sexes, chicken, hawk-dove
3. Solve for equilibria of games in normal form, extended form, in pure & mixed strategies, with perfect and imperfect information
4. Understand the role of information, sequencing, credible commitments, repetition, etc.
5. Become familiar with some of the economics (and other) literatures that use game theoretic tools
6. Use game theory tools to explore a topic in writing
