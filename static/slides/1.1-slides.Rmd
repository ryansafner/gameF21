# What A Game Is...in Math

.pull-left[

- A game is defined as $\Gamma = (s_1,s_2, \cdots, s_n;u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_n)$:

1. Players $i \in \{1,2,\cdots, N\}: N \geq 2$
2. Strategies $s_i \in \{S_i\}$
  - $S_i$ is the set of all strategies available to player $i$
3. Payoffs $u_i \in \{s_i, s_{\neg i}\}$
  - $u_i: S_i \times S \cdots S_{\neg i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

# Example: 2-person Game

.pull-left[

1. Players
  - 1 and 2
2. Strategies
  - $s_1 \in S_1$ and $s_2 \in S_2$
3. Payoffs
  - $u_1 \in \{s_1, s_2\}$
  - $u_2 \in \{s_1, s_2\}$

# We Are Ruling Out Situations

.pull-left[

- Where strategy does not matter (i.e. pure chance)

- Without strategic interaction between players (i.e. a “single-player” game)

# 

- This is a game:
  - More than 1 player
  - Strategies available to each player
  - Payoffs jointly determined by strategies chosen

- You just don’t happen to know *who* the other player is
  - But you still need to think about (how to respond to) their strategies

---

# We Can Represent This 

- We can represent this (and any) game in two ways:
  - Both describe all three elements of the game

.pull-left[

- .hi[“Normal”] or .hi[“Strategic”] form (a matrix)

.pull-right[

- .hi[“Extensive”] form (a game tree)

# Solution Concepts

.pull-left[

- In order to be a useful tool/model, need a .hi[solution concept] to predict outcome
  - Otherwise, what’s the point of the model?

- Game theory models are a special type of .hi[equilibrium model], so we want to find the .hi[equilibrium] of a game
