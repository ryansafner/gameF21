&gt; “Sherlock Holmes, pursued by his opponent, Moriarty, leaves London for Dover. The train stops at a station on the way, and he alights there rather than travelling on to Dover. He has seen Moriarty at the railway station, recognizes that he is very clever and expects that Moriarty will take a faster special train in order to catch him in Dover. Holmes’s anticipation turns out to be correct. But what if Moriarty had been still more clever, had estimated Holmes’s mental abilities better and had foreseen his actions accordingly? Then, obviously, he would have travelled to the intermediate station [Canterbury]. Holmes again would have had to calculate that, and he himself would have decided to go on to Dover. Whereupon, Moriarty would again have ‘reacted’ differently,” (p.173-4).

# Expected Value

- .hi[Expected value] of a random variable `\(X\)`, written `\(E(X)\)` (and sometimes `\(\mu)\)`, is the long-run average value of `\(X\)` "expected" after many repetitions

`$$E(X)=\sum^k_{i=1} p_i x_i$$`

--

- `\(E(X)=p_1x_1+p_2x_2+ \cdots +p_kx_k\)`

- A **probability-weighted average** of `\(X\)`, with each possible `\(X\)` value, `\(x_i\)`, weighted by its associated probability `\(p_i\)`

- Also called the .hi["mean"] or .hi["expectation"] of `\(X\)`, always denoted either `\(E(X)\)` or `\(\mu_X\)`

# Mixed Strategies

.pull-left[

- .hi[Pure strategy]: is a complete strategy profile that a player will play
  - Recall, .hi[strategy] is a list of choices player will take at every possible decision node

  - Plays a variety of pure strategies according to probabilities

# Mixed Strategies

.pull-left[

- The logic of mixed strategies is best understood in the context of repeated constant-sum games

- If you play one strategy repeatedly (i.e. a .hi[pure strategy]), your opponent can exploit your (predictable) strategy with their best response

- You want to “keep your opponent guessing”

# Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

.pull-left[

- We have already seen Nash equilibrium in pure strategies (PSNE)

- Nash (1950) proved that any `\(n\)`-player game with a finite number of pure strategies has at least one equilibrium
  - A game may have no PSNE, but there will always be a unique .hi[mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE)]
  - Games may have *both* pure and a mixed NE

- Finding this is relatively straightforward with two players and two strategies

1. Let *p* be the probability of one player playing one of their available strategies
  - Let *(1-p)* be the probability of that player playing their other available strategy
2. Let *q* be the probability of the other player playing one of their available strategies
  - Let *(1-q)* be the probability of that player playing their other available strategy

# The Minimax Theorem

.pull-left[

# Penalty Kicks: 50:50?

.pull-left[

- .hi-red[Kicker]'s “randomizing” 50:50 (.red[Kick Left], .red[Kick Right]) was not random enough!

- .hi-red[Kicker] can do better by picking a better `\(p\)` (and similarly, so can .hi-blue[Goalie])
  - Hint: if .hi-blue[Goalie] knew .hi-red[Kicker]'s `\(p\)` before .hi-blue[Goalie] chose, would he have a clearly better choice of .blue[Dive Left] vs. .blue[Dive Right]?
