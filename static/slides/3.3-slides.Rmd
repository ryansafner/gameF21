  3. **Don't be envious**: focus on maximizing your own score, rather than ensuring your score is higher than your "partner's"

    - Each player can observe history
    - The value of future interactions must be sufficiently important to players

        - sufficiently high probability of game continuing $\theta$
- If this is true, *many* strategies can sustain long-run cooperation
    - Any in the teal set in the diagram before

  - This is why game theorists use the grim trigger strategy results as the *bare minimum* sufficient strategy for cooperation
    
- As temptation payoff increases relative to Nash equilibrium, need higher $\delta$ or $\theta$ to sustain cooperation

# Using Market Forces to Enforce Contracts: Reputation

> "Since every contingency cannot be cheaply specified in a contract or even known and because legal redress is expensive, transactors will generally also rely on an implicit type of long-term contract that employs a market rather than legal enforcement mechanism, namely, the imposition of a capital loss by the withdrawal of expected future business. This goodwill market-enforcement mechanism undoubtedly is a major element of the contractual alternative to vertical integration," (p.303)

> "One way in which this market mechanism of contract enforcement may operate is by offering to the potential cheater a future 'premium,' more precisely, a price sufficiently greater than average variable (that is, avoidable) cost to assure a quasi-rent stream that will exceed the potential gain from cheating. The present-discounted value of this future premium stream must be greater than any increase in wealth that could be obtained by the potential cheater if he, in fact, cheated and were terminated. The offer of such a long-term relationship with the potential cheater will eliminate systematic opportunistic behavior," (p.304).

> "The larger the potential one-time 'theft' by cheating (the longer and more costly to detect a violation, enforce the contract, switch suppliers, and so forth) and the shorter the expected continuing business relationship, the higher this premium will be in a nondeceiving equilibrium. This may therefore partially explain both the reliance by firms on long-term implicit contracts with particular suppliers and the existence of reciprocity agreements among firms...The threat of termination of this relationship mutually suppresses opportunistic behavior. The premium stream can be usefully thought of as insurance payments made by the firm to prevent cheating," (pp.304-5)
