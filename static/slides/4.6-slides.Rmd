# Equilibrium in Sequential Bayesian Games

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We looked at a simultaneous game of incomplete information

- Now let's look at some common models of sequential games with incomplete information, and some famous applications

- Again, typically assume that .blue[Player 2] has private information about their “type,” that .red[Player 1] does not know

# Equilibrium in Sequential Bayesian Games

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- We needed Bayes’ Rule because we will use it to describe how rational players .hi-purple[update their beliefs] (about others’ type) when presented with new evidence (i.e., the other player makes a move)

- Players share common (prior) belief about likelihood of encountering a player-type $(p)$

- .blue[Informed player] with private information (their type) will make a move, .red[uninformed player] will **update** their belief about .blue[that player]’s type

# Our Previous Bayesian Example as a Signalling Game

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Consider our previous game in sequential form

- A .hi[signalling game] where .blue[Colin] moves first

- .red[Rowena] observes .blue[Colin]'s move (.blue[Cooperate] or .blue[Defect]), but does not know which type .blue[Colin] is (and thus, the consequences of her own move)

- We could again find what conditions lead to valid .hi-purple[pooling equilibria] and .hi-purple[separating equilibria]
    - But I'd rather focus on applications of these famous models

- Essentially, .blue[Colin] makes a move, either .blue[Cooperate] or .blue[Defect]

- .red[Rowena]’s prior beliefs about .blue[Colin]’s type $(p)$ get updated based on .blue[Colin]’s move

- Then .red[Rowena] must decide how to respond, given her (updated) posterior belief about .blue[Colin]’s type

# Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE)

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- A possible solution for a sequential game with incomplete (asymmetric) information is known as an .hi[assessment] which has **two parts**:

1. A .hi-purple[behavioral strategy profile]: complete plan of action for each player about how to play at each information set

2. A .hi-purple[belief system]: probability distribution over nodes in each information set
  - estimate how likely a player is a particular type, **given** their action

# Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE)

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- An assessment is a .hi[Perfect Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (PBNE)] if it fits both conditions:

1. .hi-purple[Sequentially rational] — i.e. credible & survives backwards induction
  - at each information set, strategies are optimal given beliefs
2. It is .hi-purple[consistent with Bayes’ Rule] 
  - beliefs are updated by Bayes' Rule wherever possible

# Signaling vs. Screening Games

.pull-left[

- Used to explore the economic problem of .hi-purple[adverse selection]: informed players exploit uninformed players 
  - Again, one player has private information (their type), the other doesn’t know

- Let .red[Player 1] be the .red[“uninformed player”]

- .blue[Player 2] be the .blue[“informed player”] with private information about their **type**

# Signaling vs. Screening Games

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Two types of sequential games with adverse selection:

1. .hi[Screening games]: .red[uninformed player] moves first
  - Will try to *determine* what type the *other* player is
  - Offer options where .blue[informed players] can *self-select* and reveal their type

2. .hi[Signaling games]: .blue[informed player] moves first
  - Will try to *signal* their type to .red[uninformed player]
  - But “bad”-types also want to *signal* they are “good”-types!

> One day two women came to King Solomon, and one of them said: 

> Your Majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. Not long ago my baby was born at home, and three days later her baby was born. Nobody else was there with us.

> One night while we were all asleep, she rolled over on her baby, and he died. Then while I was still asleep, she got up and took my son out of my bed. She put him in her bed, then she put her dead baby next to me.

> In the morning when I got up to feed my son, I saw that he was dead. But when I looked at him in the light, I knew he wasn’t my son.

> "No!" the other woman shouted. "He was your son. My baby is alive!"

> "The dead baby is yours," the first woman yelled. "Mine is alive!"

> "Please don’t kill my son," the baby’s mother screamed. "Your Majesty, I love him very much, but give him to her. Just don’t kill him."

> The other woman shouted, "Go ahead and cut him in half. Then neither of us will have the baby."

> Solomon said, "Don’t kill the baby." Then he pointed to the first woman, "She is his real mother. Give the baby to her."

This essay is about the endogenous market process whereby the employer requires (and the individual transmits) information about the potential employee, which ultimately determines the implicit lottery involved in hiring, the offered wages, and in the end the allocation of jobs to people and people to jobs in the market,” (pp.356-357).

For if no signaling takes place, each person is paid his unconditional expected marginal product, which is just $[2-q_1]$. Group II may also be worse off than it was with no signaling. Assume that the proportion of people in Group I is 0.5.
