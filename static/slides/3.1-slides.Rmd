> “Sherlock Holmes, pursued by his opponent, Moriarty, leaves London for Dover. The train stops at a station on the way, and he alights there rather than travelling on to Dover. He has seen Moriarty at the railway station, recognizes that he is very clever and expects that Moriarty will take a faster special train in order to catch him in Dover. Holmes’s anticipation turns out to be correct. But what if Moriarty had been still more clever, had estimated Holmes’s mental abilities better and had foreseen his actions accordingly? Then, obviously, he would have travelled to the intermediate station [Canterbury]. Holmes again would have had to calculate that, and he himself would have decided to go on to Dover. Whereupon, Moriarty would again have ‘reacted’ differently,” (p.173-4).

# Expected Value

- .hi[Expected value] of a random variable $X$, written $E(X)$ (and sometimes $\mu)$, is the long-run average value of $X$ "expected" after many repetitions

$$E(X)=\sum^k_{i=1} p_i x_i$$

--

- $E(X)=p_1x_1+p_2x_2+ \cdots +p_kx_k$

- A **probability-weighted average** of $X$, with each $x_i$ weighted by its associated probability $p_i$

- Also called the .hi["mean"] or .hi["expectation"] of $X$, always denoted either $E(X)$ or $\mu_X$

.green[**Example**]: Suppose you lend your friend $100 at 10% interest. If the loan is repaid, you receive $110. You estimate that your friend is 99% likely to repay, but there is a default risk of 1% where you get nothing. What is the expected value of repayment?

# Mixed Strategies

.pull-left[

- .hi[Pure strategy]: is a complete strategy profile that a player will play
  - Recall, .hi[strategy] is a list of choices player will take at every possible decision node
  
- .hi[Mixed strategy] is a probability distribution over a strategy profile
  - Plays a variety of pure strategies according to probabilities

# Mixed Strategies

.pull-left[

- The logic of mixed strategies is best understood in the context of repeated zero-sum games

- If you play one strategy repeatedly (i.e. a .hi[pure strategy]), your opponent can exploit your (predictable) strategy with their best response

- You want to “keep your opponent guessing”

# Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

.pull-left[

- We have already seen Nash equilibrium in pure strategies (PSNE)

- Nash (1950) proved that any $n$-player game with a finite number of pure strategies has at least one equilibrium
  - A game may have no PSNE, but there will always be a unique .hi[mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE)]
  - Games may have *both* pure and a mixed NE

# Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Finding this is relatively straightforward with two players and two strategies

1. Let $p$ be the probability of one player playing one of their available strategies
  - Let $(1-p)$ be the probability of that player playing their other available strategy
2. Let $q$ be the probability of the other player playing one of their available strategies
  - Let $(1-q)$ be the probability of that player playing their other available strategy

- There exists some $(p,q)$ mix that is a Nash equilibrium in mixed strategies

# The Minimax Theorem

.pull-left[

- In constant sum games, note that even in *mixed* strategies, one player increases their own (expected) payoff by pulling down the other player's (expected) payoff!

- In this game, even expected payoffs always sum to 100
  - .hi-red[Kicker]'s $\mathbb{E[\pi]}=75.5$
  - .hi-red[Goalie]'s $\mathbb{E[\pi]}=24.5$

- von Neumann & Morgenstern’s .hi[minimax theorem] (simplified): in a 2-person, constant sum game, each player maximizes their own expected payoff by minimizing their opponent's expected payoff

# Penalty Kicks: 50:50?

.pull-left[

- .hi-red[Kicker]'s “randomizing” 50:50 (.red[Kick Left], .red[Kick Right]) was not random enough!

- .hi-blue[Goalie] recognizing this pattern can exploit it and hold down .hi-red[Kicker]'s expected payoff

- .hi-red[Kicker] can do better by picking a better $p$ (and similarly, so can .hi-blue[Goalie])
  - Hint: if .hi-blue[Goalie] knew .hi-red[Kicker]'s $p$ before .hi-blue[Goalie] chose, would he have a clearly better choice of .blue[Dive Left] vs. .blue[Dive Right]?

- This principle is the same in non-constant sum games too!

- Implies game is played repeatedly

# Goalie's Optimal Choice of q: Algebraically

- Find value of .blue[q] that equates .hi-red[Kicker]'s expected payoff of .red[Kick Left] and .red[Kick Right]:

$$\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[\color{red}{Left}] &= \mathbb{E}[\color{red}{Right}] \\
\mathbb{E}[\color{red}{58}q+\color{red}{95}(1-q)] &= \mathbb{E}[\color{red}{93}q+\color{red}{70}(1-q)] \\
\end{align*}$$

--

- $q^\star = 0.417$

--

- .hi-blue[Goalie] plays .blue[Dive Left] with $q=0.417$ and .blue[Dive Right] with $1-q = 0.583$

--

  - .hi-red[Kicker]'s expected payoff of .red[Kick Left]: $\color{red}{58}(0.417)+\color{red}{95}(0.583) \approx \color{red}{79.57}$

  - .hi-red[Kicker]'s expected payoff of .red[Kick Right]: $\color{red}{93}(0.417)+\color{red}{70}(0.583) \approx \color{red}{79.57}$
