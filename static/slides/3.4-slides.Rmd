> “[I]f variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection,” (Ch. 4).

> “[If] we want to understand why selection has favoured particular phenotypes [then] the appropriate mathematical tool is optimisation theory. We are faced with the problem of deciding what particular features ... contribute to fitness, but not with the special difficulties which arise when success depends on what others are doing. It is in the latter context that game theory becomes relevant,” (p.1).

> “Sensibly enough, a central assumption of classical game theory is that the players will behave rationally, and according to some criterion of self-interest. Such an assumption would clearly be out of place in an evolutionary context. Instead, the criterion of rationality is replaced by that of population dynamics and stability, and the criterion of self-interest by Darwinian fitness,” (p.2).

1. A **dominated** strategy *cannot* be evolutionarily stable

2. Evolution can be *inefficient*

3. If a strategy, $s$ is an ESS, then $(\color{red}{s},\color{blue}{s})$ must be a Nash equilibrium
  - monomorphic equilibria require symmetric $(\color{red}{s},\color{blue}{s})$ ESS Nash equilibria
  - the converse is not true

- When $V<C$ (Chicken), neither **Hawk** nor **Dove** is evolutionarily stable!

- No .hi-purple[monomorphic] population is possible

- This is because neither (.red[Hawk], .blue[Hawk]) or (.red[Dove], .blue[Dove]) are PSNE!
  - Again: if strategy $s$ is ESS, then $(\color{red}{s},\color{blue}{s})$ must be a PSNE!

- There is a *better* response against a Hawk (or Dove) than Hawk (or Dove) itself!
  - A monomorphic population of Hawks (or Doves) can always be invaded!

- The side-blotched lizard (*Uta stansburiana*) is polymorphic with three morphs, each pursuing a different mating strategy
    1. *Orange-throated*: strongest and very aggressive, don't form strong pair bonds
    2. *Blue-throated*: middle-sized, form strong pair bonds and guards female
    3. *Yellow-throated*: smallest, color mimics females (sneaks into orange's territory)

- Each phenotype can successfully invade another: it's Rock-Paper-Scissors

- Creates a 6-year population cycle

# Asymmetric Games

.pull-left[

- Games played between *different* species
    - Insects and plants
    - Predator and prey
- Games are played by asymmetrically positioned members of same species
    - Current owner of a nesting ground or food source
    - Current mate vs. competitor
- Amazing thing is: many confrontations are resolved peacefully
    - Current owner of food source keeps it

# The Hawk-Dove Game: Bourgeois Strategy

.pull-left[

- An .red[Owner] (of territory) and an .blue[Intruder]
  - $\color{red}{V} \neq \color{blue}{v}$
  - Often $\color{red}{V} > \color{blue}{v}$: local knowledge, home turf advantage, sunk cost, etc 

- Individual organism might find itself in either role (as either player) at different times

# The Hawk-Dove Game: Bourgeois Strategy

.pull-left[

- The .hi-purple[“Bourgeois strategy”] conditions behavior on the organism's role:
  - Play **Hawk** if .red[Owner], play **Dove** if .blue[Intruder]

- A *conditional strategy* (like Bourgeois) is an ESS iff it is a strict PSNE:
  - (.red[Hawk], .blue[Dove]) is a **PSNE** when $V<c$ and $v<c$
  - (.red[Dove], .blue[Hawk]) a “paradoxical strategy” (but also **PSNE**)
