- *Possible* strategic choices and payoffs of each outcome to each player *are* known by all players

- Must think not only about own best strategic choice, but also the best strategic choice of *other* player(s)

- .hi[Normal] or .hi[strategic form]

  - First payoff in a cell goes to .hi-red[Row], second to .hi-blue[Column]
  - But order doesn’t matter (!)

- Dimensions of matrix
  - Rows: possible strategies available to .hi-red[Row]
  - Columns: possible strategies available to .hi-blue[Column]

- For now, we only look at .hi-purple[discrete] strategies (and a single decision per player)

# Nash Equilibrium, Again

.pull-left[  
- Again, in a .hi-purple[Nash equilibrium], no player wants to change strategies given the strategies played by all other players
  - Equivalently, each player is playing a best response to other players' strategies

  - If .hi-blue[Column] plays .blue[A], .hi-red[Row]'s best response is .red[B]
  - If .hi-blue[Column] plays .blue[B], .red[A] and .red[B] are both best responses

- Symmetrically for .hi-blue[Column]

- Finds all three Nash equilibria (in each, both players play a best response)
  1. (.red[B], .blue[A])
  2. (.red[A], .blue[B])
  3. (.red[B], .blue[B])

- Let's first try solving by searching for dominated strategies...

- .purple[Game Show] is dominated by .purple[Sitcom] for .hi-purple[ABC], so delete it

# Summary of Methods of Finding Nash Eq.

.smallest[
Ranked from (most to least) effective and (most to least) tedious:

1. .hi-purple[Cell-by-cell inspection]
  - For each outcome, ask: would any player like to change strategy given others' strategies?
  - Every outcome where all players answer “NO” is a Nash equilibrium

2. .hi-purple[Best response analysis]
  - For each possible strategy of *other* players, what is a player's best response?
  - If **all** players are playing a best response in an outcome, that's a Nash equilibrium

3. .hi-purple[Successive elimination of dominated strategies]
  - Eliminate (dominated) strategies players will never play
  - If a single strategy remains for each player, that's the Nash equilibrium
  - Ties cause you to rule out potential Nash equilibria!
