# Simultaneous Games and Imperfect Information

.pull-left[
- Let’s consider the simultaneous-move **Stag Hunt** in **strategic form**

- We can't model this as an *extensive form* game with perfect information
    - Each player doesn’t know what the other chose

# Simultaneous Games and Imperfect Information

.pull-left[
- We *can* model it in **extensive form** with **imperfect information**
  - Let .red[Row] move first (order really doesn't matter with symmetric payoffs)

- .red[Row]’s move is hidden from .blue[Column]:
  - Can't distinguish between the **history** where .red[Row] chose .red[Stag] and the history where .red[Row] chose .red[Hare].

# Simultaneous Games and Info Sets

.pull-left[

- .hi-purple[Information set] (dotted line/oval connecting decision nodes) for .blue[Column] `\(\implies\)` can’t distinguish between histories of .red[Stag] or .red[Hare]

- .blue[Column] doesn’t know if they are deciding at node .blue[C.1] or .blue[C.2] (whether .red[Row] has played .red[Stag] or .red[Hare])

- Note changing who moves first here makes no difference on the game, since “second-mover” still does not know what “first-mover” chooses!

# Strategies and Information Sets

.pull-left[
- Strategies available to player within an information set must be the same across all decision nodes/histories

- If they are different, player can tell which history they are on given the unique strategies available to them
  - .blue[Column] would clearly know if they are at node .blue[C.1] or .blue[C.2] since strategies available are different!

# Strategies and Information Sets

.pull-left[

  - (i.e. *always* .blue[Stag] or *always* .blue[Hunt]) at *both* (.blue[C.1] and .blue[C.2])
  - Can’t play (.blue[Stag], .blue[Hare]) or (.blue[Hare], .blue[Stag]) at .blue[(C.1,C.2)]

- Again, doesn’t know what decision node they are actually deciding at

# Strategies and Information Sets

.pull-left[
- Clarify what we mean by .hi[strategy]: a complete plan of action of all the decisions a player will make at every possible **information set**
  - (rather than merely every decision node)

- Until now, information sets have consisted of a single decision node (“singleton”)
]

.pull-right[

# Perfect Information

.pull-left[
- We can now more precisely define .hi[perfect information]: no information sets contain multiple decision nodes (are all “singleton” nodes)

- Individual can differentiate between histories of game at each decision node

# Stag Hunt with Perfect Information

.pull-left[

- With **perfect information**, .blue[Column]’s strategies can be conditional on what .red[Row] plays
  1. .blue[(Stag, Stag)]
  2. .blue[(Stag, Hare)]
  3. .blue[(Hare, Stag)]
  4. .blue[(Hare, Hare)]

- Each information set is a singleton (i.e. nodes .blue[C.1] and .blue[C.2] each contain a separate information set)

# Stag Hunt with Perfect Information

- Using normal form, three Nash equilibria with **perfect information**:
1. {.red[Stag], .blue[(Stag, Stag)]}
2. {.red[Stag], .blue[(Stag, Hare)]}
3. {.red[Hare], .blue[(Hare, Hare)]}

2. **{.red[Stag], .blue[(Stag, Hare)]}**

# Imperfect Information and Subgame Perfection

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- With .hi-purple[imperfect information], some information sets contain multiple decision nodes

- A subgame must contain all nodes in the information set, cannot “break” information sets
  - Nodes .blue[2.1] and .blue[2.2] do *not* initiate subgames (breaks information sets)
  - The *only* subgame possible is the overall game itself (contains all nodes in information set)
  
- We **cannot** use subgame perfection as a solution concept here

# Imperfect Info. May Imply A Simultaneous Game

.pull-left[

- .blue[Column] cannot play any *conditional* strategies depending on what .red[Row] does
  - Can’t know what .red[Row] will play!
  - Must choose an *unconditional* strategy to always play .blue[Stag] or .blue[Hare]
  
- All we can do is solve the game via strategic form as usual

# Incomplete Information

---

# Incomplete Information

.pull-left[
- Even in games with imperfect information (e.g. simultaneous games), we have assumed information was .hi-purple[complete]
  - Players know the rules, strategies available, and the payoffs to each player

- Source of uncertainty was .hi-purple[strategic]: players didn’t know the **history** of the game (moves made by other players)
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/uncertainty.jpg)
]
]

---

# Incomplete Information

.pull-left[
- Now consider games with .hi[incomplete information]
  - Players don’t know something about the game
  - Common example: what the payoffs to the other player are (but know your own)

- Textbook calls this .hi-purple[external uncertainty]: the game is not fully clear due to some undetermined external factors 
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/uncertainty.jpg)
]
]

---

# External Uncertainty: Playing with Nature

.pull-left[
- We can deal with .hi-purple[external uncertainty] by including **Nature** as a player

- **Nature** has no strategic interest in the outcomes (has no payoff and no objectives)

- Really just a metaphor for rolling (possibly weighted) dice
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/nature.jpg)
]
]

---

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- Consider a .red[Farmer] who (ignoring competition) must determine what crops to plant: .red[Beans], which do better in dry seasons; or .red[Rice] which does better in wet seasons

- Let **Nature** decide what the weather this season will be
  - With some probability `\(p\)`, **Nature** will “choose” a **wet** season

- .red[Farmer] can’t know what **Nature** chose
]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature.png)
]
]

---

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- .red[Farmer] must maximize **expected payoff**

- Consider a mixed strategy “against” **Nature**

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature_normal.png)
]
]

---

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- .red[Farmer] must maximize **expected payoff**

- Consider a mixed strategy “against” **Nature**

`$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Beans}]&amp;=E[\color{red}{Rice}] \\
2p &amp;= 2-2p\\
p^\star &amp;= 0.50 \\
\end{align*}$$`

- If `\(p&gt;0.50\)`, .red[Farmer] should plant .red[Beans]
- If `\(p&lt;0.50\)`, .red[Farmer] should plant .red[Rice]

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature_normal.png)
]
]

---
# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- Now suppose .red[Farmer] can estimate (based on experience, forecasts, etc) `\(p\)` to be 0.40

- Now .red[Farmer] has a pure strategy “against” **Nature**

`$$\begin{align*}
E[\color{red}{Beans}]&amp;&lt;E[\color{red}{Rice}] \\
(0.40)2+(0.60)0+ &amp;&lt; (0.40)0+(0.60)2\\
0.80 &lt; 1.20 \\
\end{align*}$$`

- Definitely plant .red[Rice]

]

.pull-right[
.center[
![](../images/farmer_nature_known_p.png)

]

---

# External Uncertainty: Simple Example

.pull-left[

- Key here is .red[Farmer]’s .hi-purple[beliefs] about `\(p\)`

# Asymmetric Information

.pull-left[
- A particular type of incomplete information is .hi[asymmetric information], where players might not know all relevant information about others
  - Other player’s strategies, payoffs, preferences, or “type”

- Typically, one player has important .hi-purple[private information] about themself that other players are not privy to

information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters,” (p.159).

This approach will be based on constructing, for any given game [of incomplete information], some game [of complete information] game-theoretically equivalent to [the first game].” (pp.164—165).

# Pooling Eq. II: Both Types Defect (?)

- ✅ This is a valid .hi-purple[Bayesian Nash Equilibrium]: {.red[Defect], .blue[(Defect, Defect)]}
  - Where .blue[Colin]’s strategies are denoted for (.blue[PH-type Colin], .blue[SH-type Colin])

# Bayesian Nash Equilibria

.pull-left[
- Our two possible .hi-purple[Bayesian Nash equilibria (BNE)]:

1. {.red[Defect], .blue[(Defect, Defect)]}, a .hi-turquoise[pooling equilibrium]

2. {.red[Defect], .blue[(Cooperate, Defect)]}, a .hi-turquoise[separating equilibrium], if `\(p&gt;\frac{2}{3}\)`
  - If `\(p&lt;\frac{2}{3}\)`, no equilibrium

- Note that these depend on .red[Rowena]’s .hi-purple[beliefs] about `\(p\)`!
  - Next...why these are **Bayesian** games
