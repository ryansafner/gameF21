# Discounting the Future

- Now consider an infinitely repeated game

--
  - If a player receives payoff $p$ in every future round, the **present value** of this infinite payoff stream is
    
$$p(\delta+\delta^2+\delta^3+ \cdots)$$
  - This is due to compounding interest over time
--

- This infinite sum converges to:

$$\sum_{t=1}^\infty=\frac{p}{1-\delta}$$
- Thus, the present discounted value of receiving $p$ in every future round is $\left(\frac{p}{1-\delta}\right)$

# Prisoners' Dilemma, Infinitely Repeated

# Payoffs in Grim Trigger Strategy

    - If you both *Cooperate* forever, you receive an infinite payoff stream of 3 per round

$$3+3\delta+3\delta^2+3\delta^3+\cdots+3\delta^{\infty}=\frac{3}{1-\delta}$$

2.  $\delta$ as .hi-purple[sufficiently high probability of repeat interaction]

    - Each player can observe history
    - The value of future interactions must be sufficiently important to players
        - sufficiently high discount rate $\delta$
        - sufficiently high probability of game continuing $\theta$
- If this is true, *many* strategies can sustain long-run cooperation
    - Any in the teal set in the diagram before
    - *Grim trigger* is simply the bare minimum/worst case scenario (and, importantly, easiest to model!)

# Assessing the Folk Theorem

- **The Good**: cooperation is possible, rational, and efficient!
  - Any improvement above (D,D) is a Pareto improvement for all players
    
- **The Bad**: lack of predictive power
  - Anything goes! Almost *any* outcome can be a sustainable equilibrium
  - This is why game theorists use the grim trigger strategy results as the *bare minimum* sufficient strategy for cooperation
    
- As temptation payoff increases relative to Nash equilibrium, need higher $\delta$ or $\theta$ to sustain cooperation
